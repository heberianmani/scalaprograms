//Encapsulation is a concept of hiding the members and provide only the functionality using the members.
// Access specifiers (public, private, protected) and modifiers (val/var)
// Public class can access all public members, 
// Derived class can access protected members, 
// Companion object(object with same name of the class) can access private members
// Other members of the same Encapsulated class can also access public/protected/private members
// because of the above point through the public member of the base class, 
// can access the private/protected members indirectly - eg. of Encapsulation 
// Public class or object can access the private/protected indirectly using the other public member of the class eg. amtCanDispatched

// Question - When do we instantiate a base class or extend the base class?
// 1. If we extend, we can achieve all types of inheritance., if I instantiate I can't achieve inheritance provided if the base class is inherited 
// 2. Trait - we cant instantiate the trait class to access the member we only can extend
// 3. By extends we can access protected members. But using Obj instantiation, we canâ€™t access protected members
// 4. If we extend a class we can achieve multilevel inheritance and access multiple members from parent & child class, but when we use obj we need to create multiple objects to access the members
// 5. We can extend a class by another derived class where both the classes are not instantitated yet, 
// but ready for instantiation later, where as if we instantiate the object will be created immediately by loading the class in the memory of the object created.
